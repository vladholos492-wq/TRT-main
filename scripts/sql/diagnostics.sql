-- Safe to run in production (all queries have LIMIT and use indexes)

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES:
-- ============================================================================
-- - All queries use indexes (ts DESC, event, user_id, task_id, cid)
-- - All queries have LIMIT to prevent long-running queries
-- - Replace 'YOUR_CID_HERE' in query #9 with actual correlation ID
-- - Adjust time intervals as needed (24 hours, 7 days, etc.)
-- - Run during low-traffic periods for large time ranges
